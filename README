Number Attack requires the following dependencies:

-libncurses/libcurses
-build-essential
-some sort of compiler (like gcc, which is programmed in the makefile by default.)

With everything installed type "make" to compile numberattack.
	-Don't plan on installing it or are copying the binary to another machine? You can stop here!

Type "make install" to install number attack to the system. Type "numattack" from anywhere to run.

Likewise, type "make uninstall" to uninstall number attack.

Type "make clean" to remove any compiled binaries in the build directory.
